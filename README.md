```css
:root {
    --primary-color:   #8e44ad;   /* Main accent color */
    --secondary-color: #9b59b6;   /* Secondary accent color */
    --completed-color: #7f8c8d;   /* Color for completed tasks */
    --delete-color:    #e74c3c;   /* Delete button color */
    --background:      #f5f6fa;   /* Page background */
    --card-bg:         #ffffff;   /* Todo card background */
    --text-color:      #2c3e50;   /* Main text color */
    --border-color:    #ecf0f1;   /* Border color */
}
```

### Adding Features
